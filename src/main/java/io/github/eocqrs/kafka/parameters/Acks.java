/**
 * It's a wrapper for the `acks` kafka attribute.
 * The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader
 * to have received before considering a request complete.
 * This controls the durability of records that are sent.
 * The following settings are allowed:
 * <strong>acks=0</strong>
 * <strong>acks=1</strong>
 * <strong>acks=all</strong> or <strong>acks=-1</strong>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>acks=0</strong>
 * <br>
 * If set to zero, then the producer will not wait
 * for any acknowledgment from the server at all.
 * The record will be immediately added to the socket buffer
 * and considered sent.
 * No guarantee can be made that the server has received
 * the record in this case,
 * and the retries configuration will not take effect
 * (as the client won't generally know of any failures).
 * The offset given back for each record will always be set to -1.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>acks=1</strong>
 * <br>
 * This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will
 * respond without awaiting full acknowledgment from all followers.
 * In this case should the leader fail immediately after
 * acknowledging the record,
 * but before the followers have replicated it, then the record will be lost.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>acks=all</strong> or <strong>acks=-1</strong>
 * <br>
 * This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas
 * to acknowledge the record.
 * This guarantees that the record will not be lost
 * as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive.
 * This is the strongest available guarantee.
 * </p>
